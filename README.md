## Usage

Video and image examples for testing are provided in the `Use` directory.
The file numbers correspond, so `string1.png` is the image for `f1.mp4`, etc.

Download the `Use` directory, open it in terminal, and run the program as follows:
* `st Images/<imagename> Videos/<videoname>`, where the image and video match
* For example, `st Images/string1.png Videos/f1.mp4` will run the program with the image and video corresponding to the first harmonic

### Output

The expected output is the three calculations made by the program: the harmonic of the wave, the frequency of the wave, and the calculated tension.
